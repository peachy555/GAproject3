# Highlight (by Peach)

## General Information
Another one week build project I created for my final project at General Assembly.

This project was inspired by my experience when I was writing my final thesis for engineering degree. I, personally, like to print out physical copy of research paper, so that I can highlight relevant contents or write notes to it. After going through several paper, the process be came confusing, hard to organise and time consuming. Especially, when I wish to refer back to what I read before. Therefore I wanted to make a "digitalised" version of this research process with search functionality.

The user can create new projects and add multiple research pages or contents onto it. Each projects will have their own sets of custom highlighters that users can create. Users can easily highlight page's content by selecting one of the highlighters then click and drag across the desired section. Users can also see or add new notes to each highlight by clicking on that highlight.

Highlight is a single page application and is heavily relied on JavaScript, jQuery, underscore.js and AJAX for all their actions. It can be broken down in to 4 JS files, highlight.es6 contains all code related to highlighting of contents, link.es6 contains all eventlistenters for openning different modal to create new elements, search.es6 contains highlight searching algorithm and settings.es6 contains all JavaScript used or related to setting page.

## Further Implementations
* WebSockets
* node.js & react.js
* Chrome extension or other means to import content
